            <h2>Be Warned!</h2>
            <p>I want to preface this by saying that I know everyone has a different experience in not only Asia but
                every
                country
                in the world. This entire website is based off of my own personal experiences and contains my own
                personal
                opinion.
                In no way, shape, or form am I saying that everyone in Asia is like what I'm describing. Their are a
                vast
                amount of
                different people and countries and everything I am describing is based off of my own experiences and
                opinons. I hope
                that this will at the least give you some idea of the differences between my life living in Asia and my
                life
                back home
                in Houston.
