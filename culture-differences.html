        <p>I want to preface this by saying that I know everyone has a different experience in not only Asia but every country 
            in the world. This entire website is based off of my own personal experiences and contains my own personal opinion.
            In no way, shape, or form am I saying that everyone in Asia is like what I'm describing. Their are a vast amount of 
            different people and countries and everything I am describing is based off of my own experiences and opinons. I hope
            that this will at the least give you some idea of the differences between my life living in Asia and my life back home 
            in Houston.
