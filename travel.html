        <p>I hadn't ever left the United States until I was 18. I had traveled all over the US many times but never to a
            foreign
            country. I did however, always have a facination with other cultures. My favorite classes in school were
            history. I loved
            learning about the Romans and the early British Empire and many other diffferent and interesting facits of
            world history.
            But I wouldn't come to realize my facination with the outside world until I experienced it myself. The first
            place I evere travelled
            to was Germany. I went with my family as part of a graduation gift from highschool. The second I landed and
            was experiencing
            new language and new sights and foods and feelings I was instantly in love with being abroad. However, for
            many reasons, the
            biggest being that I was 18 and didn't know what I wanted. I didn't take any action on my new love for being
            abroad. Outside of the
            two weeks I spent travelling in Germany and Austria.

            I first went to Germany in 2012 as part of a highschool graduation gift. I went with family to visit many of
            the different cities
            such as Berlin, Frankfurt, Cologne, and Munich. Since we were only ther for about two weeks we weren't able
            to
            do much in every single city, however, I was able to enjoy every second of it. My favorite city was probably
            Munich,
            at the time I had never really experienced a large city on the style that you can find in Europe, or Asia,
            or even
            New York. I'm from Houston, and while it is the fourth biggest city in the US we have so much land in Texas
            that their
            is no reason to build up. We can easily get by, by building out. So I wasn't used to the sprawling city
            scape of Berlin.
            So at the time Munich was more of my style as it is a perfect mix between the city center you can find in
            many urban cities
            as well as the open roads and sidewalks of a suburban area.
