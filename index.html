        <p>Hello my name is Dominic Waters and I just recently returned to the US after speding five years living abroad
            in
            Asia.
            I spent five years living abroad. And while it was never part of my plan I enjoyed every minute of it and I
            hope
            that you will have a new found respect for living abroad. As well as develop an interest in Asia after
            looking
            at this site. I'm using this blog to help document my life abroad not only for myself but also for anyone
            else who is interested in going abroad. Or anyone else who is tired of being told what they<b> should</b> do
            with
            their future and instead focus on what they <i>want</i> to do with their futures.
            I'm nowhere near an English major so please forgive any mistakes. Additionally I'm using this site and the
            blog
            contained
            to help practice my coding so please forgive any frequent changes or updates. I hope everyone here will have
            a
            better
            understanding of life abroad and the choices that you can make that will help you enjoy a more developed and
            interesting life.</p>
